# Chest-X-Ray-Diagnostic-Model-Evaluation
I will be working with the results of the X-ray classification model that i did previously. I will also use our manually labeled test dataset of 420 X-rays.  

 dataset contains X-rays from 14 different conditions diagnosable from an X-ray. I'll evaluate our performance on each of these classes using the classification metrics such as:


1. Accuracy
1. Prevalence
1. Specificity & Sensitivity
1. PPV and NPV
1. ROC curve and AUCROC (c-statistic)
1. Confidence Intervals
